# bunq-sdk

## Intro
This project demonstrates a proof of concept (POC) for leveraging Wirespec to develop a robust SDK for the Bunq API.

By using Wirespec, a pure functional and dependency-free model, SDKs have been generated for four different languages (
Java, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript). The SDKs all follow the same structure.
